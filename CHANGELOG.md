# v1.1.4

## This release requires Ionic 1.3 and Angular 1.5

- Added ```allow-mid-range``` parameter prevents footer from stopping halfway when dragging (defaults to false)
- Fixes #17 where footer position was wrong when used in multiple views with different template structures (tabs, headers)
- Minor UI fixes and improvements

### Breaking changes
- Removed ```toggle``` attribute from ```ion-pull-up-handle``` directive in favor of two new attributes that allow for better control of icons: ```icon-expand``` and ```icon-collapse```. Also, there is not need to specify a default icon as a child element as the directive will add it to the DOM.

````
<ion-pull-up-handle icon-expand="ion-chevron-up" icon-collapse="ion-chevron-down" style="border-radius: 25px 25px 0 0">
</ion-pull-up-handle>
````
